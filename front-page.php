					<p>Built on the foundation of an extensive research effort that includes leading doctors, scientists, engineers and architects, Delos is on a mission to transform ordinary homes into intelligent spaces that nurture and sustain well&#8209;being.</p>
					<p>By combining the brightest ideas in residential living with scientifically&#8209;driven wellness technologies and solutions, Delos has permanently changed the concept of what a home can provide.

For a difference you can feel on an individual level, day after day.</p>
					<p>Through this process of pioneering research and invention, Delos created the WELL Building Standard&trade;, the world's first building standard exclusively focused on health and wellness.
